Across the US for residential power, the average price of a megawatt hour is $122.20

Pennsylvania Energy production for 2015 from:
Coal: 64,637,233 megawatt hours
Natural Gas: 59,454,655 megawatt hours

Pennsylvania Carbon Dioxide Emissions for 2015 from:

Coal: 63,729,258 metric tons
Natural Gas: 25,136,109 metric tons

Pennsylvania Carbon Dioxide emissions for 2015 in tons from:

Coal: 70,249,482 tons
Natural gas: 27,707,817 tons

The amount of tons of carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt hour of power produce from a different types of power plants

Coal: 1.086826875772977 tons
Natural Gas: 0.4660327605971307 tons

The average efficiency of a power plant: 88% (boiler and combustion efficacy)* 38% (steam cycle efficacy) = 33.44% (overall efficacy)

Using that efficiency to calculate the amount of kilojoules needed for a kilowatt by fuel type 3600 (kilojoules in a kilowatt)/0.3344(efficiency) = 10765 kilojoules per kilowatt hour

Heat values per ton for different fuels:

Coal: 10765 (Kilojoules per kilowatt)/ 30080 (kilojoules per kilogram of Medium Volatile Bituminous coal) = 0.334 (kilograms of coal per kilowatt hour)
Natural Gas:

Amount of fuel needed for 500 megawatt hours by fuel type:

Coal: 0.334(kilograms of fuel per kilowatt hour) * 1000 (kilowatt hours in a megawatt hour) * 500 (that makes 500 megawatt hours) = 167,000 kilograms an hour needed for 100

Amount of fuel needed for 500 megawatt hours in tons by fuel type

Coal: 167,000 (kilograms of coal per 500 megawatt hours) * 0.00110231 (conversion rate) = 184.085989 =~ 184 tons

Cost of 500 megawatt hours in dollars by fuel type:

Coal: 184 (amount of tons of bituminous medium volatile coal per 500 megawatt hours) * 51.57 (bituminous coal per ton) = $9,488.88 (Cost per hour for a coal plant)

Amount of Carbon Dioxide emitted for a 500 megawatt hour plant by fuel type:

Coal: 1.086826875772977 (tons of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour) * 500 = 543.4134378864885 =~ 543 tons

Estimated Cost of building a plant per kilowatt hour cap by fuel type:

Coal: $3,500

Cost of building a 500mgh plant by fuel type:

Coal: 3,500 (cost per kilowatt hour) * 500,000 (amount of kilowatt hours in 500 megawatt hours) = 1,750,000,000 or 1.75 billion dollars
